I want to create a next-generation web protocol called WebX:// where hyperlinks carry instructions or page blueprints instead of pointing to a server. The goal is to make a proof-of-concept prototype fully on Replit. Here are the requirements:

1. **WebX Protocol Basics**  
   - Hyperlinks are in the format `WebX://<payload>`, where `<payload>` is URL-safe base64 JSON.  
   - Each JSON blueprint contains:
       - title (string)
       - layout (one of ["article", "card", "newsfeed", "gallery", "form"])
       - data (array of content objects: heading, paragraph, list, etc.)
       - ai (optional instructions for AI-assisted content generation)
       - meta (version, author, protocol name)
   - Replit should be able to decode and render the payload client-side without downloading HTML from a server.

2. **WebX Renderer (Client-Side)**  
   - HTML/JS page that:
       - Accepts a WebX:// link or base64 payload input.  
       - Decodes the payload and renders it using simple styled cards or article layouts.  
       - Optionally, if `ai` instructions are present, can call an AI endpoint or stub for content expansion.  
   - Must show a live preview of the decoded JSON and the rendered page.  
   - Should be mobile-friendly and simple to deploy.

3. **WebX Link Composer (Client-Side)**  
   - Web UI to create a blueprint:
       - Fields for title, layout, content blocks, and AI instructions.  
       - Exports a valid WebX:// link (URL-safe base64 of JSON).  
       - Live preview of the rendered page from the blueprint.  

4. **Optional AI Integration (Future Step)**  
   - Provide a stub API endpoint that can accept a prompt and return generated content.  
   - Later, this can be connected to OpenAI, TinyLlama, or other models.

5. **Project Setup**  
   - Replit project should be static or Node-based (whichever is easiest to integrate AI later).  
   - Include instructions in the README for:
       - Testing a WebX link  
       - Creating blueprints with the composer  
       - Rendering pages from WebX:// links

6. **Stretch Goals** (if possible)  
   - Add a browser-like UI that intercepts WebX:// links.  
   - Multiple layouts/themes support.  
   - Ability to save/load multiple blueprints locally.  

**Goal:** By the end, I want a working Replit project that allows me to:
- Paste a WebX:// link and see the page generated locally.  
- Build new WebX links using a simple composer.  
- Preview blueprints and optionally call a placeholder AI function.  

Please generate the Replit project scaffold with the HTML, JS, CSS, and any necessary backend stubs for AI integration.
